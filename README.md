# Sales Dashboard
This report presents a Comprehensive Descriptive Data Analysis of the sales data from an Electronics Outlet. The analysis encompasses a dataset of *25116 Entries* representing *178K individual orders*. This dataset comprises customer orders spanning a year, commencing in *January 2019* and concluding in *December 2019*. The objective of this data analysis was to systematically examine and underscore the sales performance of the outlet's electronic products. The purpose of this examination was to derive valuable insights that could inform and guide future strategic decision-making for the outlet.
 
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of sales data in order to identify trends, top-selling products, and key revenue metrics to support informed business decision-making. The project encompasses several critical steps:
**Data Collection and Cleaning:** This initial phase involves identifying data sources, extracting relevant data, and eliminating errors or inconsistencies.
**Data Exploration:** This stage is dedicated to uncovering trends and patterns within the sales data. We will investigate variations in sales over time and disparities in sales among different products and regions.
**Top-Selling Products:** Calculating the sales figures for each product and identifying the products that have generated the highest sales.
**Revenue Metrics:** This entails computing essential financial metrics, including total sales and profit margins. We will determine the overall revenue generated by the company from sales and assess the percentage of that revenue which constitutes profit.
**Data Visualization:** The final step in this project involves creating clear and concise visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to effectively convey our findings.
